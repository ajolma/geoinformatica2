ABOUT

Geoinformatica is a geospatial toolkit that builds on Perl, Cairo,
GTK+, and GDAL. The toolkit consists of libral, which is a raster
algebra and geospatial data visualization library written in C, and
of a number of Perl modules.

The toolkit aims as a general purpose analytical tool for geospatial
data, (graphical) application development environment, and web service
toolkit.

Geoinformatica2 is a reboot of Geoinformatica and it is planned to
use new versions of most of the components of Geoinformatica.
